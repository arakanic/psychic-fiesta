The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. 
This function helps determine prospective members which category they will be placed.

To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. 
In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

Function input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. 
Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.
The output will consist of a list of string values stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.
